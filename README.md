Problem statement
Adult children of elderly parents face significant anxiety due to the lack of timely updates and effective
communication about their loved ones' health. This disconnect hampers access to essential medical reports
and histories, complicating coordination of care. Patients struggle to manage their healthcare needs, leading
to missed medications, unmanaged diets, and delayed appointments. Additionally, maintaining accurate
medication histories is challenging, risking medication errors and continuity of care. In emergencies,
retrieving verified health insurance details is often difficult, resulting in delays and increased stress for both
patients and providers.
